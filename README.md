# InstaRally
 This website uses Google map's API to allow users to create markers based on events that are happening around them. This process is extremely simple with all that is needed is information about the user and event. If connected to an actual database, this would allow people from across the world to see everyone's markers. That information is then used on another page of the website to give more insight on the specific event/rally.

Inspiration
At a time where protests and rallies seem to be battling misinformation on a daily basis, we wanted to create an application that allows people to congregate in a simple and quick manner. We believe it is important that everyone has a voice in the community they live in, but sometimes just a singular person is not enough. Racial injustice, voting rights, and climate change are all social injustices that plagued 2020. With 2021 underway, we can finally put 2020, a grueling and hectic year, to rest. Our team at RallyTech created a simple way to assist in complex problems.

How we built it
The team split into two groups. The first group focused on setting up the website. This included structuring the HTML and making sure every web page worked together seamlessly. The other group worked on the Google Maps API by making sure that all markers were properly placed and all details about the event were recorded and saved. Stylizing the website was a full team effort, where we each contributed our css knowledge and unique ideas to make the website as appealing as our coding skills allowed us.

Challenges we ran into
Flutter was difficult to learn quickly. We ended up scrapping our application around 5 hours in and switched to creating a website
Working together as a team to finish a project
Working through Covid-19
Utilizing a variety of languages and packages: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS, Google, etc and integrating it
Lack of sleep
Updating user input in the events page
Trouble shooting JSON issues (Storing user information so that it can be accessed on multiple webpages)
Difference in devices (between team members)
